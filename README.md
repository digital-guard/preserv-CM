## Territorial organization
The national territory and its subdivisions represent *jurisdictions*:

* The country is divided into *10 regions* (then-provinces), semi-autonomous, that are headed by a governor appointed by the president of the republic.
The geocodes of the regions follow the convention registered by ISO 3166-2:CM. In OpenStreetMap it is agreed that the subdivision by regions corresponds to administrative level 4.

* The regions are subdivided into *58 departments* that are headed by divisional officers (_pr√©fets_) appointed by the president of the republic.

* The departments are subdivided into communes (_arrondissements_) that are headed by assistant divisional officers (_sous-prefets_).

* The communes are subdivided into districts that are headed by district heads (_chefs de district_).

The urban cadastres are found in the communes.

The jurisdiction that assigns names to streets and the urban numbering system is the commune.
